                <p>User accounts are identified by an ethereum wallet address. This can be resolved in any number of ways or simply shared directly (more on that later).</p>
                <p>Each user publishes the following json object onto IPFS. This returns a root hash corresponding to the current state of that user's public profile.</p>
                <p>
                  The root hash json object contains these things;

                <p>Each user has an outbox object linked within their root hash. This contains a list of all the hashes for replies (individually signed) that they would like to send. These are sorted and grouped under their destination ethereum address.</p>
                <p>If I am following someone and they post a reply to something I post, then that is automatically approved and added as a child to the node they are replying to.</p>
                <p>If a reply is posted to someone who is not following the person psoting the reply, then it goes to an approval inbox.</p>
                <p>It seems like it would make sense to have a limit on this so that bobts cant just flood every post. Maybe you can reply to those who are following you, and you can reach the inbox of someone who is a friend of a friend, but beyond that your replies get filtered out.</p>
                <p>Here is what the outbox object looks like;
                  <ul>
                    <li>Etereum address for this user</li>

                <h2 class="display-1">resolving root hashes from ethereum addresses</h2>
                <p>This is the really hard part of the project. Everyone will be constantly updating our root hashses any time anything changes. Getting that new root hash to your followers in a way that is totally distributed and nonhierarchical is a really challenging problem. Distributed naming systems are certainly not a perfectly solved problem yet but lots of people are working on solutions. I think we can use all of these solutions or whichever one we prefer.</p>
                <p>One idea I have experimented with during my research for this project has been building a custom DHT network built into the apps people will use to access the network, or built into a distributed service worker on a web page. But there are lots of solutions already in place, and there's no reason not to just use them all.</p>
                <h4>Round-Robin Resolution</h4>
                <p>One simple and popular strtategy for current DNS systems is to simply replicate several versions of a server and then publish the addresses for all of them as A-Records, so that users will just randomly pick one to send their requests to. This is called Round-Robin DNS. It can work the other way for this project. Simply publish your changes to all the distributed name services like the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipns/" target="_blank">Interplanetary Name System</a>, the <a href="https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service" target="_blank">Ethereum Name System</a>, <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/dnslink/" target="_blank">DNSLink</a>, etc. Just use them all and then whichever one returns an answer first is what users can use. This will certainly get better as we move forward, but it works fine for now and being redundant increases the resiliency of the system.</p>
                <h4>DHT? Pub/sub?</h4>
                <p>One idea I have experimented with during my research for this project has been building a custom DHT network built into the apps people will use to access the network, or built into a distributed service worker on a web page.</p>
                <p>There are also lots of secure, distributed message passing services available that could be used automatically between friends to share current keys in a pub/sub pattern.</p>
                <h4>Web Gateways</h4>
                <p>Most browsers don't support IPFS yet, so we will have to be able to fall back on gateways for IPFS anyway. So why not also use gateways for key resolution? </p>
                <p>It would be really simple to create a post/get rest api where everyone can post their new hash with a signature. Then verify and store that, and serve it to whoever asks for it. I've done the math and it looks like this would scale in a pretty straightforward and not-resource-intensive way.</p>

                <h2 class="display-1">ipfs considerations</h2>
                <p>Nothing can ever really be deleted once it's published, so that's something to keep in mind.</p>
                <p>IP Addresses are public, so including or assuming something like TOR as a substrate might be a good idea if we want to anonymize users' physical addresses.</p>
                <p>In order to "host" each other's content, everyone should at a minimum automatically "pin" the current state of their friends. This would also accelerate the user experience by pre-loading everything your friends publish so you can just open the app or site and have everything there waiting for you, rather than fetching it once you want to look at it.</p>
                <p>On that note, one of the most exciting parts of this idea is that it works completely offline. A completely disconnected, off-grid community in the middle of nowhere can use this.</p>

                <p>I will be starting with a web based version of this project that works either through gateways or IPFS based on what your browser supports. This will be available at <a href="https://our-space.io/" target="_blank">our-space.io</a> or you can check out <a href="https://github.com/cjtrowbridge/our-space-web-bootstrapper" taget="_blank">the repository on github</a>.</p>
